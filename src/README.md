# This is a simple weather application: 
  
- A small project, but a good way to increase my exposure to APIs
- Utilizes the free Weatherstack API to gather weather information
- User may input their location to recieve information on the local weather
- Currently only able to track the current weather due to limitations of free API use
- Users must use their own API key, this is to prevent the public sharing of keys

- Current version is limited due to API fees, but might be updated in the future if things change
